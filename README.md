- [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation)
- [ABP Framework](https://abp.io/)
- [.Net 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)

### Installing Template

Install the ABP Vue .Net Template

```bash

```

### Creating a new project

Create a new project using the template

```bash
dotnet new abp-vue -o my-project-name
```

> Note: You can use any name for the project. I used `my-project-name` for this example. keep in mind that the project name should be in kebab case (all lowercase and words separated by hyphens) because it will be used as the name of the packages org name.

### Running the project

```bash
cd my-project-name
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## What is this?

This is a Vue UI for the [ABP Framework](https://abp.io/). We are just getting started it is not ready for production, However, you can use fork it with your own risk. We are using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Why Use ABP Vue?

In the past we have used Angular and React for the ABP Framework. We have also used Blazor for the ABP Framework. We have not yet used Vue for the ABP Framework. Vue is a very popular framework and it is very easy to use. We are building this project to provide a Vue UI for the ABP Framework. We are also building this project to provide a reference for anyone who wants to build a Vue UI for the ABP Framework.

## LightHouse Score

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a Vue UI for the ABP Framework.
It will be a fully functional UI that can be used as a starting point for any ABP project. It will also be a reference for anyone who wants to build a Vue UI for ABP. We will try to implement all the features of the ABP Framework Open Source Application.

## Features

- [] Landing Page
- [x] Login, Logout, Register, Forgot Password (Without UX)
- [] Multilingual
- [] Theme Switcher
- [] Profile
- [] Tenant Management
- [] Role Management
- [] User Management
- [] Settings Management
- [] Feature Management

## Roadmap

Most of the features are implemented. We are planning to keep it similar to the ABP Framework Open Source Application. That means all the commercial features will not be implemented.
