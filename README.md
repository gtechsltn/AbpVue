## What is this?

This is a Nuxt Vue-based UI for the ABP Framework. It has the basic UI features that come with Abp.io UI frameworks, You can customize it the way you want and use it. It uses AbpTemplate as the backend. It is built using Nuxt, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Flowbite.

## Why Use ABP Vue?

In the past, we have used Angular and React for the ABP Framework. We have also used Blazor. However, I thought that having a Vue-based UI template for the ABP Framework would be a nice touch. Nuxt3 is a prevalent framework and it is straightforward to use. I am building this project to provide a Vue-based UI for the ABP Framework. I am also building this project to provide a reference for anyone who wants to build it in Nuxt3.

## Goals

This project aims to provide a Vue UI for the ABP Framework.
It will be a fully functional UI that can be used as a starting point for any ABP project. It will also be a reference for anyone who wants to build a Vue-based UI for the ABP framework. I will try to implement all the non-commercial ABP Framework application features.

## Features

- [x] Landing Page
- [x] Login, Logout, Register, Forgot Password (default MVC Auth server)

Most of the features are implemented. We are planning to keep it similar to the ABP Framework Open Source Application. That means all the commercial features will not be implemented.
